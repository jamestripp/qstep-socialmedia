# R Natural Language Processing

This folder contains a R notebook file. In this file, we examine the output of a natural language processing model applied to our reddit data.

# Usage

The .rmd file in this directory can be openend up in RStudio. The R notebook format allows one to run code alongside text in a rather nice format. More details about the R notebook format are available from the rmarkdown book section dedicated to R notebooks [here](https://agnor.lnx.warwick.ac.uk/social_media/6_natural_language.html).

An HTML version of the output (which you can view within the browser) can be viewed [here](https://agnor.lnx.warwick.ac.uk/social_media/2_scraping.html).

# Going further

Natual language processing is an interesting area. There are lots of packages (e.g., see the [CRAN natural langauge processing view](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/NaturalLanguageProcessing.html)) and cleanNLP seems to be the best for easily integrating with the tidyverse. You may find the below links to be useful.

* [Stanford CoreNLP](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P14-5010) - An excellent and classic library for natual language processing.
* [Spacy homepage](https://spacy.io) - The python package we used above. If you applying the above in your own projects then please work through this page to usderstand some of the nuances of the program.
* [CleanNLP article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.09570.pdf) - The paper contains some analysis which we did not do above. Furthermore, the references in the paper are useful for better understanding the approach.
* [Detecting politeness](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018/RJ-2018-067/RJ-2018-067.pdf) - Natual language processing has the potential of identifying more nuanced components of anlaysis, such as politeness.

In general, you should find some data and play around. Try to get a sense of what your data is and understand what it is telling you.
