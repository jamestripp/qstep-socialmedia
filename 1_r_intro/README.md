# R Intro

This folder contains a R notebook file. The purpose of the file is to introduce you to core R concepts such as variable, function and packages.

# Usage

The .rmd file in this directory can be openend up in RStudio. The R notebook format allows one to run code alongside text in a rather nice format. More details about the R notebook format are available from the rmarkdown book section dedicated to R notebooks [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html).

An HTML version of the output (which you can view within the browser) can be viewed [here](https://agnor.lnx.warwick.ac.uk/social_media/1_r_intro.html).

# Going further

If you do want to go further, then you should play around with some data and read the documentation from the RStudio folks. There are links to some of these page on the main page of the gihub repository and below:

* [R for data science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) - An excellent book introducing the tidyverse approach to data science. 
* [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) - Web page detailing the tidyverse collection of package and how to use them.
* [RStudio Cheat sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) - A whole collection of cheatsheets. The ggplot and dplyr sheets are perhaps most useful given the above.
* [RStudio essentials](https://resources.rstudio.com) - Videos available on the RStudio page.
* [Rstudio Essentials of Data Science](https://resources.rstudio.com/the-essentials-of-data-science) - Nice collection of videos on various data science topics in R.
* [Datacamp tidyverse for beginners](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/tidyverse-cheat-sheet-beginners) - A somewhat simpler cheat sheet which is great for those coming to the tidyverse for the first time.
