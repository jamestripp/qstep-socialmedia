# R Text Analysis

This folder contains a R notebook file. In this segment, we follow the [Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com) book in carrying our sentiments analysis, looking at N-Grams and some topic modelling with Reddit data collected using the [RedditExtractor]() package. You can - assuming there is time remaining in the workshop - to work with your own Reddit query.

# Usage

The .rmd file in this directory can be openend up in RStudio. The R notebook format allows one to run code alongside text in a rather nice format. More details about the R notebook format are available from the rmarkdown book section dedicated to R notebooks [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html).

An HTML version of the output (which you can view within the browser) will be available before the start of the workshop.

# Going further

The Text Mining with R book chose the analysis we use in this session to demonstrate their package. These methods are still used. A nice recent review of the different packages and methods is [Text Analysis in R](https://kenbenoit.net/pdfs/text_analysis_in_R.pdf). There are online paid course (for example [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/text-mining-with-r)) but I have not taken these and you can learn a lot using free resources.

Machine learning is becoming a popular technique. Models which have been pretrained on large collections of text are used to categorise text. In the next segment, we will dip our toes into this approach. An excellent text is [Deep learning with R](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Deep-Learning-R_p1-Joseph-Allaire/dp/161729554X). I heartily recomend reading through that book if you are interested in machine learning.

I have listed a few more resources below. These can be tricky and you are best going with the book and paper mentioned above.
